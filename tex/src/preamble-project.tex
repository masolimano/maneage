%% Packages you may need in your project
%% -------------------------------------
%
%% Here you can add/remove any custom LaTeX package that you need for this
%% project that aren't provided by the journal's style.

%% For loading images into the output (with '\includegraphics').
\usepackage{graphicx}

%% Ordering correction between 'figure' and 'figure*' ('figure*' is
%% commonly used in two-column documents, where the figure should span both
%% columns).
\usepackage{fixltx2e}

%% Color management.
\usepackage{xcolor}
\color{black} % Color of main text.
\definecolor{DarkBlue}{RGB}{0,0,90}

%% Caption management: The 'setspace' package defines the 'stretch'
%% variable. 'abovecaptionskip' is the distance between the figure and the
%% caption. You can use 'captionof{figure}{...}' to use these custom
%% 'figure' caption that is defined here.
\usepackage{setspace, caption}
\captionsetup{font=footnotesize, labelfont={color=DarkBlue,bf}, skip=1pt}
\captionsetup[figure]{font={stretch=1, small}}
\setlength{\abovecaptionskip}{3pt plus 1pt minus 1pt}
\setlength{\belowcaptionskip}{-1.25em}

%% Manage links in the produced paper (for example their colors), and
%% include document information in the "Properties" of the PDF.
\usepackage[
  colorlinks,
  urlcolor=blue,
  citecolor=blue,
  linkcolor=blue,
  linktocpage]{hyperref}
\renewcommand\UrlFont{\rmfamily}
\hypersetup{
    pdftitle={\projecttitle},
    pdfauthor={\projectcopyrightowner},
    pdfsubject={\projectgitrepo{} (commit \projectversion)},
    pdfkeywords={Reproducible research, Maneage, ADD YOUR OWN}
}





%% BibLaTeX or PGFPlots templates
%% ------------------------------
%
%% These are ready-made customizations of these two commonly used packages
%% that you can use as a template for your own project: BibLaTeX (advanced
%% bibliography management) or PGFPlots (for drawing plots within LaTeX
%% directly from tables of data). If you don't use them, you can just
%% delete these two lines and also delete their files from your branch (to
%% keep the 'tex/src' directory on your branch clean).
\input{tex/src/preamble-biblatex.tex}
\input{tex/src/preamble-pgfplots.tex}





%% Style of default paper (DELETE IF USING JOURNAL STYLES)
%% -------------------------------------------------------
%
%% This is primarily defined for the default Maneage paper style. So when
%% you later import your journal's style, delete this line (and these
%% comments). Also delete the file (to keep your project source branch
%% clean from files you don't need/use).
\input{tex/src/preamble-maneage-default-style.tex}
