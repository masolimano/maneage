# Files to ignore in version control (Git) -*- conf-unix -*-
# ==========================================================
#
# The files satisfying the patterns here (one per line) are ignored by
# the version control using Git, they are all outputs of the various
# tools used to built Gnuastro, so we don't need to keep their
# history.
#
# To help readability, please add new files based on the length of the
# line you wish to add.
