# Check file permission handling (POSIX-compatibility)
# ----------------------------------------------------
#
# Check if a 'given' directory handles permissions as expected.
#
# This is to prevent a known bug in the NTFS filesystem that prevents
# proper installation of Perl, and probably some other packages. This
# function receives the directory as an argument and then, creates a dummy
# file, and examines whether the given directory handles the file
# permissions as expected.
#
# Returns '0' if everything is fine, and '255' otherwise. Choosing '0' is
# to mimic the '$ echo $?' behavior, while choosing '255' is to prevent
# misunderstanding 0 and 1 as true and false.
#
# ===== CAUTION! ===== #
#
# Since there is a 'set -e' before running this function, the whole script
# stops and exits IF the 'check_permission' (or any other function) returns
# anything OTHER than '0'! So, only use this function as a test. Here's a
# minimal example:
#
#     if $(check_permission $some_directory) ; then
#       echo "yay"; else "nay";
#     fi ;
check_permission ()
{
    # Make a 'junk' file, activate its executable flag and record its
    # permissions generally.
    local junkfile="$1"/check_permission_tmp_file
    rm -f "$junkfile"
    echo "Don't let my short life go to waste" > "$junkfile"
    chmod +x "$junkfile"
    local perm_before=$(ls -l "$junkfile" | awk '{print $1}')

    # Now, remove the executable flag and record the permissions.
    chmod -x "$junkfile"
    local perm_after=$(ls -l "$junkfile" | awk '{print $1}')

    # Clean up before leaving the function
    rm -f "$junkfile"

    # If the permissions are equal, the filesystem doesn't allow
    # permissions.
    if [ $perm_before = $perm_after ]; then
        # Setting permission FAILED
        return 1
    else
        # Setting permission SUCCESSFUL
        return 0
    fi
}





# Check if there is enough free space available in the build directory
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Use this function to check if there is enough free space in a
# directory. It is meant to be passed to the 'if' statement in the
# shell. So if there is enough space, it returns 0 (which translates to
# TRUE), otherwise, the funcion returns 1 (which translates to FALSE).
#
# Expects to be called with two arguments, the first is the threshold and
# the second is the desired directory. The 'df' function checks the given
# path to see where it is mounted on, and how much free space there is on
# that partition (in units of 1024 bytes).
#
# synopsis:
# $ free_space_warning <acceptable_threshold> <path-to-check>
#
# example:
# To check if there is 5MB of space available in /path/to/check
# call the command with arguments as shown below:
# $ free_space_warning 5000 /path/to/check/free/space
free_space_warning()
{
    fs_threshold=$1
    fs_destpath="$2"
    return $(df "$fs_destpath" \
                | awk 'FNR==2 {if($4>'$fs_threshold') print 1; \

    cc, c++            Generic C/C++ compiler (possibly links to below).
    gcc, g++           Part of GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).
    clang, clang++     Part of LLVM compiler infrastructure.

If your compiler is not checked, please get in touch with the web-form
below, so we add it. We will try our best to add it soon. Until then,
please install at least one of these compilers on your system to proceed.

NOTE: for macOS systems, the LLVM compilers that are provided in a native
Xcode install are recommended. There are known problems with GCC on macOS.

The 'sys/cdefs.h' header cannot be included, or a usable static C library
('libc.a', in any directory) cannot be used with the current settings of
this system. SEE THE ERROR MESSAGE ABOVE.

Because of this, we can't build GCC. You either 1) don't have them, or 2)
the default system environment aren't enough to find them.

1) If you don't have them, your operating system provides them as separate
packages that you must manually install. Please look into your operating
system documentation or contact someone familiar with it. For example on
some Redhat-based GNU/Linux distributions, the static C library package can
be installed with this command:

    $ sudo yum install glibc-static

2) If you have 'libc.a' and 'sys/cdefs.h', but in a non-standard location (for
example in '/PATH/TO/STATIC/LIBC/libc.a' and
'/PATH/TO/SYS/CDEFS_H/sys/cdefs.h'), please run the commands below, then
re-configure the project to fix this problem.

    $ export LDFLAGS="-L/PATH/TO/STATIC/LIBC \$LDFLAGS"
    $ export CPPFLAGS="-I/PATH/TO/SYS/CDEFS_H \$LDFLAGS"

Project's local configuration
-----------------------------

Below, some basic local settings will be requested to start building
Maneage on this system (if they haven't been specified on the
command-line). This includes the top-level directories that Maneage will
use on your system. Most are only optional and you can simply press ENTER,
without giving any value (in this case, Maneage will download the necessary
components from pre-defined webpages). It is STRONGLY recommended to read
the description above each question before answering it.

downloading necessary programs and data if they aren't already present (in
directories that you can specify with this configure script). Therefore if
the necessary files are not present, the project will crash.

===============
Build directory
===============

The project's "source" (this directory) and "build" directories are treated
separately. This greatly helps in managing the many intermediate files that
are created during the build. The intermediate build files don't need to be
archived or backed up: you can always re-build them with the contents of
the source directory. The build directory also needs a relatively large
amount of free space (atleast serveral Giga-bytes), while the source
directory (all plain text) will usually be a mega-byte or less.

'.build' (a symbolic link to the build directory) will also be created
during this configuration. It can help encourage you to set the actual
build directory in a very different address from this one (one that can be
deleted and has large volume), while having easy access to it from here.

--- CAUTION ---
Do not choose any directory under the top source directory (this
directory). The build directory cannot be a subdirectory of the source.

# Find Zenodo URL for software downloading
# ----------------------------------------
#
# All free-software source tarballs that are potentially used in Maneage
# are also archived in Zenodo with a certain concept-DOI. A concept-DOI is
# a Zenodo terminology, meaning a fixed DOI of the project (that can have
# many sub-DOIs for different versions). By default, the concept-DOI points
# to the most recently uploaded version. However, the concept-DOI itself is
# not directly usable for downloading files. The concept-DOI will just take
# us to the top webpage of the most recent version of the upload.
#
# The problem is that as more software are added (as new Zenodo versions),
# the most recent Zenodo-URL that the concept-DOI points to, also
# changes. The most reliable solution was found to be the tiny script below
# which will download the DOI-resolved webpage, and extract the Zenodo-URL
# of the most recent version from there (using the 'coreutils' tarball as
# an example, the directory part of the URL for all the other software are
# the same). This is not done if the option '--debug' is used.

TeX Live couldn't be installed during the configuration (probably because

final PDF (which is only done after all the analysis has been complete). It
is not used at all during the analysis.

Therefore, if you don't need the final PDF, and just want to do the
analysis, you can safely ignore this warning and continue.

If you later have internet access and would like to add TeX Live to your

    rm .local/version-info/tex/texlive-ready-tlmgr
    rm .build/software/tarballs/install-tl-unx.tar.gz

To change the configuration later, you can re-run './project configure' or
manually edit 'reproduce/software/config/LOCAL.conf'. Just be careful with
the build-directory: its location is hard-coded in the installed software
so if you change it manually, many of the project's software will crash. If
you have to use another built-directory, just re-configure a clean project
there.
