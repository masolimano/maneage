# WARNING:
#
# If the commit is aborted (e.g. by not entering any synopsis),
# then updated metastore file (.metadata by default) is not reverted,
# so its new version remains in the index.
# To undo any changes in metastore file written since HEAD commit,
# you may want to reset and checkout HEAD version of the file:
#
#     git reset HEAD -- .metadata
#     git checkout HEAD -- .metadata
#
# This script is taken from the 'examples/hooks/pre-commit' file of the
# 'metastore' package (installed within the project, with an MIT license
# for copyright). Here, the name of the 'MSFILE' and also set special
# characters for the installation location of meta-store so our own
# installation is found by Git.
