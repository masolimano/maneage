# This script is taken from the 'examples/hooks/pre-commit' file of the
# 'metastore' package (installed within the project, with an MIT license
# for copyright). We have just changed the name of the 'MSFILE' and also
# set special characters for the installation location of meta-store so our
# own installation is found by Git.
