# Lzip
# ----
#
# Lzip is a compression program that is the first built program in Maneage
# because the sources of all other programs (including other compression
# softwaer) are compressed. Lzip has the advantage that it is very small
# (without compression it is just ~400Kb). So we use its '.tar' file and
# won't rely on the host's compression tools at all.

# GNU Make
# --------
#
# The job orchestrator of Maneage is GNU Make. The
# '--disable-dependency-tracking' configure-time option is necessary so
# Make doesn't check for an existing 'make' implementation (recall that we
# aren't assuming any 'make' on the host).
#
# If GNU Guile is already present on the host system, Make will try to link
# with it, and this will cause dependency problems later. So we have
# distabled Guile. If a project needs the Guile extensions of Make, we need
# to add a build rule for Guile in Maneage, with a special Guile-enabled
# Make that has a different executable name (using the '--program-prefix='
# configure option) from the "default" make (which is this one!).

# Flock
# -----
#
# Flock (or file-lock) is necessary to serialize operations when
# necessary. GNU/Linux machines have it as part of their 'util-linux'
# programs. But to be consistent in non-GNU/Linux systems, we will be using
# our own build.
#
# The reason that 'flock' is built here is that generally the building of
# software is done in parallel, but we need it to serialize the download
# process of the software tarballs to avoid network complications when too
# many simultaneous download commands are called.
