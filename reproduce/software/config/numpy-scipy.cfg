# should leave out sections that your package does not use.

# FFT libraries
# -------------
# There are two FFT libraries that we can configure here: FFTW (2 and 3) and djbfft.
# Note that these libraries are not used by numpy or scipy.
#
#   http://fftw.org/
#   https://cr.yp.to/djbfft.html
#
# Given only this section, numpy.distutils will try to figure out which version
# of FFTW you are using.

# Even with this section, Numpy apparently does not use fftw. But we will
# keep it here for the future (if a solution is found).

# For djbfft, numpy.distutils will look for either djbfft.a or libdjbfft.a .
