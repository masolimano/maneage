# script. However, through this file, users have the option to specify the
# text surrounding those lists.
#
# We recommend to leave these values untouched at first, after building
# your PDF, you can see how they surround the list of software you used in
# your project to make a smoothly readable English text. Afterwards, please
# feel free to modify them as you wish.

# WARNING:
# In contrast to most configure files in maneage, this configure file is
# technically a shell script, to be called by 'configure.sh', so the
# variables defined here must follow 'shell' syntax, not 'make' syntax.

# These variables will be exported to the 'configure.sh' script - so
# descriptive, unique names should be used, to reduce the chance of
# conflicts between identically named variables.

# COMMENT:
# Sentences have a tendancy to become very long. To avoid making the
# variable values too long (and thus making this file hard to read), one
# method is to break the sentence into smaller components and build the
# full sentence gradually, similar to what we have done with 'str' in the
# examples below. Each time, the value of 'str' is re-written by appending
# its previous value with the rest of the sentence.

# COMMENT:
# As of 2020-06-10, the general issue of how to best cite software within
# maneage, especially a full list of software in the Acknowledgments
# section, remains wide open. See
# https://savannah.nongnu.org/task/index.php?15318 for some technical
# aspects of software citation.
