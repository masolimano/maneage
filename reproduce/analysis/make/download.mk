# Download all the necessary inputs if they are not already present.
#
# Since most systems only have one input/connection into the network,
# downloading is essentially a serial (not parallel) operation. so the
# recipes in this Makefile all use a single file lock to have one download
# script running at every instant.

# Download input data
# --------------------
#
# The input dataset properties are defined in
# '$(pconfdir)/INPUTS.conf'. For this template we only have one dataset to
# enable easy processing, so all the extra checks in this rule may seem
# redundant.
#
# In a real project, you will need more than one dataset. In that case,
# just add them to the target list and add an 'elif' statement to define it
# in the recipe.
#
# Files in a server usually have very long names, which are mainly designed
# for helping in data-base management and being generic. Since Make uses
# file names to identify which rule to execute, and the scope of this
# research project is much less than the generic survey/dataset, it is
# easier to have a simple/short name for the input dataset and work with
# that. In the first condition of the recipe below, we connect the short
# name with the raw database name of the dataset.
#
# Download lock file: Most systems have a single connection to the
# internet, therefore downloading is inherently done in series. As a
# result, when more than one dataset is necessary for download, if they are
# done in parallel, the speed will be slower than downloading them in
# series. We thus use the 'flock' program to tie/lock the downloading
# process with a file and make sure that only one downloading event is in
# progress at every moment.
