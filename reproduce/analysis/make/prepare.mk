#	If you need to add preparations define targets above to do the
#	preparations, then set the value below to 'yes'. Recall that just
#	like './project make', before loading this file, './project
#	prepare' loads loads 'initialize.mk' and 'download.mk', so you can
#	safely assume everything that is defined there in the preparation
#	phase also.
#
#	TIP: the targets can actually be automatically generated Makefiles
#	that are used by './project make'. They can include variables, or
#	automatically generated rules. Just make sure that those Makefiles
#	aren't written in the source directory. Even though they are
#	Makefiles, they are automatically built, so they don't belong in
#	the source. '$(prepdir)' has been defined for this purpose (see
#	'initialize.mk'), we recommend that you put all automatically
#	generated Makefiles under this directory. In the 'make' phase,
#	'initialize.mk' will automatically load all the '*.mk' files. If
#	you need to load your generated configuration-makefiles before
#	automatically generated Makefiles containing rules, you can use
#	some naming convension like 'conf-*.mk' and 'rule-*.mk', or you can
#	put them in subdirectories.
