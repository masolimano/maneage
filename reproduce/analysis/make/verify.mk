# Final verification TeX macro (can be empty)
# -------------------------------------------
#
# This is the FINAL analysis step (before going onto the paper. Please use
# this step to verify the contents of the figures/tables used in the paper
# and the LaTeX macros generated from all your processing. It should depend
# on all the LaTeX macro files that are generated (their contents will be
# checked), and any files that go into the tables/figures of the paper
# (generated in various stages of the analysis.
#
# Since each analysis step's data files are already prerequisites of their
# respective TeX macro file, its enough for 'verify.tex' to depend on the
# final TeX macro.
#
# USEFUL TIP: during the early phases of your research (when you are
# developing your analysis, and the values aren't final), you can comment
# the respective lines.
#
# Here is a description of the variables defined here.
#
#   verify-dep: The major step dependencies of 'verify.tex', this includes
#               all the steps that must be finished before it.
#
#   verify-changes: The files whose contents are important. This is
#               essentially the same as 'verify-dep', but it has removed
#               the 'initialize' step (which is information about the
#               pipeline, not the results).
