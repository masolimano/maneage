# High-level directory definitions
# --------------------------------
#
# Basic directories that are used throughout the project.
#
# Locks are used to make sure that an operation is done in series not in
# parallel (even if Make is run in parallel with the '-j' option). The most
# common case is downloads which are better done in series and not in
# parallel. Also, some programs may not be thread-safe, therefore it will
# be necessary to put a lock on them. This project uses the 'flock' program
# to achieve this.
#
# To help with modularity and clarity of the build directory (not mixing
# software-environment built-products with products built by the analysis),
# it is recommended to put all your analysis outputs in the 'analysis'
# subdirectory of the top-level build directory.
badir=$(BDIR)/analysis
bsdir=$(BDIR)/software

# which already has this directory.).

# Preparation phase
# -----------------
#
# This Makefile is loaded both for the 'prepare' phase and the 'make'
# phase. But the preparation files should be dealt with differently
# (depending on the phase). In the 'prepare' phase, the main directory
# should be created, and in the 'make' phase, its contents should be
# loaded.
#
# If you don't need any preparation, please simply comment these lines.

# TeX build directory
# ------------------
#
# In scenarios where multiple users are working on the project
# simultaneously, they can't all build the final paper together, there will
# be conflicts! It is possible to manage the working on the analysis, so no
# conflict is caused in that phase, but it would be very slow to only let
# one of the project members to build the paper at every instance
# (independent parts of the paper can be added to it independently). To fix
# this problem, when we are in a group setting, we'll use the user's ID to
# create a separate LaTeX build directory for each user.
#
# The same logic applies to the final paper PDF: each user will create a
# separte final PDF (for example 'paper-user1.pdf' and 'paper-user2.pdf')
# and no 'paper.pdf' will be built. This isn't a problem because
# 'initialize.tex' is a .PHONY prerequisite, so the rule to build the final
# paper is always executed (even if it is present and nothing has
# changed). So in terms of over-all efficiency and processing steps, this
# doesn't change anything.

# environment variables, we are setting it to prefer the software we have
# build here.

#	others. Also some project authors may have temporary files here
#	that are not under version control and thus shouldn't be archived
#	(although this is bad practice, but that is up to the user).
#
#	To keep the sub-directory structure, we are packaging the files
#	with Tar, piping it, and unpacking it in the archive directory. So

#	When submitting to places like arXiv, they will just run LaTeX once

#	BibLaTeX version that created it). This is hard to do with
#	non-up-to-date places like arXiv. Therefore, we thus just copy the
#	whole of BibLaTeX's source (the version we are using) into the top
#	tarball directory. In this way, arXiv's LaTeX engine will use the
#	same BibLaTeX version to interpret the '.bbl' file. TIP: you can
#	use the same strategy for other LaTeX packages that may cause
#	problems on the arXiv server.

# Directory containing to-be-published datasets
# ---------------------------------------------
#
# Its good practice (so you don't forget in the last moment!) to have all
# the plot/figure/table data that you ultimately want to publish in a
# single directory.
#
# There are two types of to-publish data in the project.
#
#  1. Those data that also go into LaTeX (for example to give to LateX's
#     PGFPlots package to create the plot internally) should be under the
#     '$(texdir)' directory (because other LaTeX producers may also need it
#     for example when using './project make dist', or you may want to
#     publish the raw data behind the plots, like:
#     https://zenodo.org/record/4291207/files/tools-per-year.txt). The
#     contents of this directory are also directly taken into the tarball.
#
#  2. The data that aren't included directly in the LaTeX run of the paper,
#     can be seen as supplements. A good place to keep them is under your
#     build-directory.
#
# RECOMMENDATION: don't put the figure/plot/table number in the names of
# your to-be-published datasets! Given them a descriptive/short name that
# would be clear to anyone who has read the paper. Later, in the caption
# (or paper's tex/appendix), you will put links to the dataset on servers
# like Zenodo (see the "Publication checklist" in 'README-hacking.md').
