# Make the final PDF?
# -------------------
#
# During the project's early phases, it is usually not necessary to build
# the PDF file (which makes a lot of output lines on the command-line and
# can make it hard to find the analysis commands and possible errors (and
# their outputs). Also, in some cases, only the produced results may be of
# interest and not the final PDF, so LaTeX (and its necessary packages) may
# not be installed at all.
#
# If 'pdf-build-final' is given the value 'yes', a PDF will be made with
# LaTeX. Otherwise, a notice will just printed that, no PDF will be
# created.
